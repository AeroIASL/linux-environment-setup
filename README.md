* install fcitx
	* get source: ```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fcitx-team/nightly```
	Notice: this ppa is no longer maintained, hence you might need to go to "software and updates/other software"to disable it before apt-get update

	* install fcitx: ```sudo apt-get install fcitx```
    * install config tool: ```sudo apt-get install fcitx-config-gtk```
    * install table-all: ```sudo apt-get install fcitx-table-all```
    * install im-switch: '''sudo apt-get install im-switch'''
    * check if fcitx is installed correclty by search its name in search bar

* install sougou
    * go to sougou website and download the linux version
    * install: ```sudo dpkg -i package_name```

* configure
    * open ***system settings -> language support***, and change ***keyboard input method system *** from ***iBus***
    to ***fcitx***
    * logout
    * go to upright corner on the screen and go to ***Peference*** (note: might be in Chinese ***She Zhi***), and add sougou pingyin
	
Manually change "input method" on upright corner of the screen, and then you should be able use ***Shift*** key to switch between two mthods.
