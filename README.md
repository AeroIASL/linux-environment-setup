## Basics:

### Zsh Setup
* Check shell info: 
	* ```echo $0``` : check **current** shell
	* ```echo $SHELL``` : check **default** shell
* Change shell to zsh:
 	* ```chsh -s $(which zsh)```
 	* logout and log back in
 	* don't forget to populate ~/.zshrc
* Install "Oh My Zsh":
	* ```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"```
	  (it should automatically edit your ~/.zshrc and ready for use)
